    "1. An embedding layer, which will learn a word embedding for all the words of the dataset. It has 3 arguments: (1) the input dimension, i.e. the size of the vocabulary (in our case the 5000 top words), (2) the output dimension, i.e. the dimension of the vector space in which words will be embedded (in our case, we set it to 32), and (3) the input length, i.e. the length of input sequences, namely the reviews (in our case, we set it to 500). Pre-trained word embeddings, such as GloVE or [Word2Vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html), are also available if you don't want to train your embeddings by yourself. So, the output of the embedding layer is a 500 x 32 matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. A dense layer with one node and with a sigmoid activation as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the decision is binary, i.e. the review can be either positive or negative, the binary_crossentropy is used for the loss function. The optimizer is the standard one (adam) and the metrics are also the standard accuracy metric."
